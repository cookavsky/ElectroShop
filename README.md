## Getting Started
I want to create a fully automated website to buy.

## Technologies
* [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.3.

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development:

To-do list:
* System login
* Sytem buying
* database
* The Appearance (Home, Search, Individual element)
* Cookies and all text

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Status
In the process, until it finishes at 100%
